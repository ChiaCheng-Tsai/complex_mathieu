==============

A C++ library to evaluate Mathieu functions the Mathieu functions of complex parameters with real arguments and integer orders.

## Introduction

C++ library that acts as a wrapper for the Fortran subroutines developed by D Erricolo and G. Carluccio in Algorithm 934: Fortran 90 subroutines to compute Mathieu functions for complex values of the parameter.
