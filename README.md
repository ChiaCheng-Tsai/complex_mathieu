==============

A C++ library to evaluate Mathieu functions the Mathieu functions of complex parameters with real arguments and integer orders.

## Introduction

C++ library that acts as a wrapper for the Fortran subroutines of Mathieu functions developed by D. Erricolo and G. Carluccio in Algorithm 934: Fortran 90 subroutines to compute Mathieu functions for complex values of the parameter. The library provides functionality to compute the Mathieu functions of complex parameters with real arguments and integer orders. The complex Mathieu Fortran library are based on the complex Bessel Fortran library from https://github.com/joeydumont/complex_bessel
